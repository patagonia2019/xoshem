        <h4>Q. What does mean Xoshem?</h4>
        
        <p><b>A.</b> <i>Xoshen</i> means "wind" in Tehuelche language, and I took the name from a legend of this people. The Tehuelches were one of the original inhabitants of Patagonia.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Q. Which tells the legend about Xoshem?</h4>
        
        <p><b>A.</b>
        The tehuelches told the original explorers that in the beginning of time, <i>K&oacute;och</i> (the creator god) lived in darkness and was overwhelmed by a great loneliness, so he cried for a long time. His tears created the sea (<i>Arrok</i>), and when he realized that the water soon cover everything, sighed, creating the wind (<i>Xoshem</i>). This wind divided the waters and created the mainland and the islands. To achieve to see his creation cleaned the darkness of the sky and created <i>X&aacute;leshen</i> (the Sun).
        <br>
        Also, to reduce the darkness he created <i>K&eacute;enguenkom</i> (the Moon), which became a powerful being. <i>X&aacute;leshen</i> got in love with the moon and for that love was born <i>Karro</i> (the evening star), whom his mother gave him the domain of the tides.
        <br>
        When <i>K&oacute;och</i> separated the waters of the land, came the two oceans. One towards the rising and another to the west (the Atlantic and the Pacific). In the Atlantic created an island inhabited by giants, one of whom was <i>Nosjthej</i> who would be the father of <i>El-lal</i>, a strong, wise and beneficent hero whom tehuelches assigned the creation of their people.
        <br>
        Lighting the three elements of space, wind, light and clouds, <i>K&oacute;och</i> did emerge from the middle of the sea a huge island, which created life: birds, animals, insects and fish. To admire the work of <i>K&oacute;och</i>, the Sun sent light and heat, the Clouds bring the rain and Xoshem was responsible for creating pasture by moving the seeds on the ground.
        <br>
        Life was developing in a quiet way on the island of tehuelches, until the appearance of giants. From that island, <i>El-lal</i> moved to Patagonia all the animals that were his faithful friends. Therefore, <i>El-lal</i> is the central character of the mythical tehuelche, a hero, a master of the hunt and protector of them.
        <br>
        It was a swan who brought <i>El-lal</i>, depositing a child on the summit of Cerro Chalten (Fitz Roy today). For three days and three nights, protected by birds, the infant watched the new land. <i>El-lal</i> was the creator of the <i>Chonek</i> (tehuelches) revealed to men the secret of fire, bow and arrows, teach them to hunt and inculcated moral principles.
        <br>
        <i>El-lal</i> descended from the mountain and joined the people. He asked them to not surrendering him honors after his departure and he returned to his island carried by a majestic swan. In this mysterious island, <i>El-lal</i> awaits the <i>Chonek</i>, those who come resurrected are guided by <i>Wend&eacute;unk, a spirit that takes account of the actions of each tehuelche.
